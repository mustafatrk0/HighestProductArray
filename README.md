# HighestProductArray

## Finding the Maximum Product

This project aims to find the highest product by calculating products of a given number of consecutive elements in a given array.

## Array

The program operates on a `uint8_t` type array called `buffer` with 1000 elements. The array contains the numbers to be multiplied within the scope of the project. The content of the array should be included within the project files.

## Running

The project is written in C/C++ and can be compiled with any C/C++ compiler. By running the `main.cpp` file, the program will display the highest product for 15 consecutive numbers, along with their starting and ending indices.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
// Other necessary libraries
// ...

int main() {
    // Contents of the program
    // ...
    return 0;
}
```

## Result
Upon running the program, you will see the highest product along with the starting and ending indices for the consecutive numbers.
